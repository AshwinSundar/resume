## Technical Skills

About: Technical skills are difficult to assess. This table is intended to communicate my technical proficiencies and amount of experience with each, in an objective and honest manner.

| **Programming Philosophies**
| Functional Programming
| Object-Oriented Programming | | | | Still my default way of programming, although recently I am growing to love blending functional techniques in where appropriate.
| SOLID/DRY Principles | | | | I think DRY is often taken too far, so I believe in knowing as much as about one's code as possible. External dependencies should be treated as SOUP (Software of Unknown Provenance), and should be understood deeply.
| **Software Development Philosophies**
| Agile/Scrum
| Test-Driven Development | 1 year | weekly engagement | 2022-2023 | Terumo 
| **Engineering Philosophies**
| Design for Six Sigma
| Industrial Statistics
| Requirements and Risk Management 
| Voice of Customer | MDT Green Belt - explain what this is
| **Soft Skills** 
| Public speaking / oratorical skills | 15+ years | varies | 2006 - present | From Speech and Debate in high school, to various teaching and training arrangements through my working career, I have always prided myself in being a good communicator.

## Education  

### B.S. Neuroscience - University of California, Los Angeles

### M.S. Biomedical Engineering - Arizona State University

- [IDENTIFICATION OF CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS IN ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY DATA USING EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION](https://ashwinsundar.com/blog/ASU-MS-Applied-Project.pdf)
  - **Advisors:** Dr. Jeff LaBelle, Dr. Mark Spano, Dr. Heather Ross
  - **Abstract:** Electrocardiography (ECG) data is often subject to frequency domain techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analysis, in order to deconstruct and understand the relationship between cardiac disease and electrical activity in the heart. However, ECG artifacts are typically brief, making frequency domain analysis challenging. An alternate method of analysis, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), may be more appropriate for analyzing short windows of data, since data analysis never leaves the time domain. EMD was applied to more than 2,000 ECG waveforms spanning a range of subjects and arrhythmia types from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Physician annotations were used to window and sort waveforms, and EMD was used to deconstruct waveforms into intrinsic mode functions (IMF). An average IMF for each arrhythmia and the healthy ECG waveform was calculated. IMFs from each arrhythmia were then compared with IMFs from healthy ECG data. This comparison can be thought to represent a unique signature of each arrhythmia type.Electrocardiography
