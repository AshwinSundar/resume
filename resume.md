#### [IDENTIFICATION OF CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS IN ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY DATA USING EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION](https://github.com/AshwinSundar/Empirical-Mode-Decomposition-for-MIT-BIH-Arrhythmia-Data/blob/master/Ashwin%20Sundar%20Final%20Report.pdf)
  - **Advisors:** Dr. Jeff LaBelle, Dr. Mark Spano, Dr. Heather Ross
  - **Abstract:** Electrocardiography (ECG) data is often subject to frequency domain techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analysis, in order to deconstruct and understand the relationship between cardiac disease and electrical activity in the heart. However, ECG artifacts are typically brief, making frequency domain analysis challenging. An alternate method of analysis, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), may be more appropriate for analyzing short windows of data, since data analysis never leaves the time domain. EMD was applied to more than 2,000 ECG waveforms spanning a range of subjects and arrhythmia types from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Physician annotations were used to window and sort waveforms, and EMD was used to deconstruct waveforms into intrinsic mode functions (IMF). An average IMF for each arrhythmia and the healthy ECG waveform was calculated. IMFs from each arrhythmia were then compared with IMFs from healthy ECG data. This comparison can be thought to represent a unique signature of each arrhythmia type.Electrocardiography
